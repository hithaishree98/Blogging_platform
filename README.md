## **Challenges**

During the project, we faced the following challenges:

- **MongoDB Validation**:  
   MongoDB Atlas' free tier restricted us from modifying validation rules via UI. We addressed this by defining strict validation rules in the Mongoose Schema.  
- **Dynamic Features**:  
   Managing real-time likes, comments, and saved blogs required careful handling of database updates and frontend rendering.  
- **Social Media Integration**:  
   Creating dynamic sharing links with query parameters for platforms like Facebook and Twitter.  
- **User Authentication**:  
   Implementing session-based authentication and restricting access to specific routes was initially tricky but resolved with middleware and secure session management.

## **Future Enhancements**

If given more time, we would like to enhance Taste Trails by adding the following features:

- **Real-Time Updates**:  
   Implement WebSocket-based real-time updates for likes and comments.  
- **Advanced Search**:  
   Allow users to search blogs based on tags, ratings, and popularity.  
- **Image Management**:  
   Integrate services like Cloudinary for secure blog image uploads.  
- **OAuth Login**:  
   Enable third-party login via Google or Facebook.  
- **Notifications**:  
   Add notifications for new comments, likes, or saved blogs.
